            <br><br>
            Horizon Zero Dawn is a 2017 action role-playing game developed by Guerrilla Games and published by Sony
            Interactive Entertainment. The plot follows Aloy, a young huntress in a world overrun by machines, who sets
            out to uncover her past. The player uses ranged weapons, a spear, and stealth to combat mechanical creatures
            and other enemy forces.
            <br><br>
            A skill tree provides the player with new abilities and bonuses. The player can
            explore the open world to discover locations and take on side quests. It was released for the PlayStation 4
            in 2017 and Microsoft Windows in 2020.
            <br><br>
            Horizon Zero Dawn is an action role-playing game played from a third-person view. Players take control
            of Aloy, a hunter who ventures through a post-apocalyptic land ruled by robotic creatures. Aloy can
            kill enemies in a variety of ways â€“ setting traps such as tripwires using the Tripcaster, shooting
            them with arrows, using explosives, and a spear.

            Ammo, resource satchels, pouches, quivers, resistance, antidotes, health potions, and
            traps can all be crafted. Weapons have modification slots for dealing more damage. Aloy wears a
            Focus, a small head piece that scans machines to determine their susceptibilities, identify their
            location, their level, and the nature of loot they will drop.

            <br><br>
            Aloy is the main protagonist of Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West. A Nora Brave, Seeker and
            machine hunter of unparalleled skill, Aloy is the genetic clone of 21st century roboticist and engineer Dr.
            Elisabet Sobeck.
            She was created by GAIA, the governing artificial intelligence of Project Zero Dawn, a global terraforming
            system that Sobeck had designed and whose implementation she had spearheaded, which restored life to Earth
            after its eradication by the Faro Plague.
            <br><br>
            GAIA created Aloy for the purpose of stopping HADES, a rogue AI
            bent on reactivating the Faro Plague in order to wipe out life again, and repair the AI itself, after it
            self-destructed in an attempt to destroy the rogue AI.
            Aloy succeeded, saving life on Earth and the humans
            of the new world that Zero Dawn created. In doing so, she unraveled the mysteries of why the world became as
            it is, and also learned the true nature of her origins.
            <br><br>
            Aloy is a white female. She is 1.68 meters (5 feet 6 inches) tall, with long red hair and freckles on her
            cheeks and nose. Her hair is pulled back with braids in the back and on the sides. She also has
            accessories in her hair such as beads. Her eyes are green and her eyebrows are narrow. A lifetime of intense
            physical activity has resulted in her being in exceptional physical condition.

            Aloy is cast out from the Nora tribe at birth and raised by a fellow outcast named Rost. As a child, Aloy
            obtains a Focus, an augmented reality device that gives her special
            perceptive abilities.
            <br><br>
            Aloy becomes curious about her origins and is told by Rost that if she wins the
            Proving, a competition to earn the right to become a member of the Nora, the tribe's Matriarchs might
            concede this information. Aloy spends some years training in combat and survival under Rost's instruction.
            <br><br>
            After coming of age, Aloy takes part in the Proving; she wins the competition, but the Nora are attacked by
            masked cultists. Rost sacrifices himself to save Aloy from their leader, Helis. When Aloy
            awakens, the Matriarchs explain that Aloy was found as an infant before a sealed door within the Nora's
            sacred mountain.
            <br><br>
            The Matriarchs name Aloy a "Seeker", allowing her to leave their lands in pursuit of the
            cultists. Aloy meets Oseram member Olin , who informs Aloy that the cultists are part of a
            splinter Carja faction called the Eclipse, and indicates that Aloy was targeted due to her resemblance to an
            Old World scientist named Elisabet Sobeck.

            Six months after the defeat of HADES, Aloy searches for a backup of GAIA to reverse the planet's degrading
            biosphere. Aloy and her friend Varl search a facility once belonging to Far Zenith, a company specializing
            in space colonization; they find a GAIA backup, but it has been sabotaged.
            <br><br>
            Sylens contacts Aloy, having stolen GAIA's subsystem HADES, and asks to meet her in the Forbidden West
            region.
            Crossing into the Forbidden West, Aloy finds the ruling Tenakth tribe are in the midst of a civil war
            between Chief Hekarro, who advocates peace with the Carja, and the rebel leader Regalla, who wishes to
            continue the war against them.
            <br><br>
            Aloy tracks Sylens to a facility where she finds HADES badly damaged, and
            permanently deletes it. She recovers a GAIA backup that is missing its subordinate functions, and resolves
            to restore it. A group of humans arrive, exhibiting futuristic technology that grant them invulnerability,
            consisting of their leader Gerard, his lieutenant Tilda, enforcer Erik, and a clone of Elisabet Sobeck named
            Beta.
